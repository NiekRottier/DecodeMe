# DecodeMe - Insightful data

DecodeMe is a website that provides insight into data that is being gathered about you by companies such as Google. Thanks to the GDPR every company is required to share the data they have on you at your request. This is done to provide transparancy, but the response is often a JSON or other data file. This is not easily accessible for most people, and counteracts the transparancy. This results in people still not being able to get any meaningful insight into their data. 

DecodeMe wants to help with this problem by providing a service where users can upload their JSON files to get a visualised overview of the contents. By looking through this overview users can gain insights and make an educated decision about how much data they want to provide to companies. DecodeMe also helps the user request their data and helps the users on their way to protect their data in the future, by providing links to interesting articles that discuss data privacy and give tips regarding this topic. 

Of course DecodeMe does not save any of the data provided by the user, not even in sessions or cookies. This is done to provide the users with an as safe as possible environment to explore their online data.

Currently DecodeMe can provide insight into:
