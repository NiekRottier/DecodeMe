# DecodeMe - Insightful data

Thanks to the GDPR, every company in Europe is required to share the data they have on you upon your request. However, the response typically comes in the form of a JSON or other data file, which is not easily accessible or meaningful for most people. As a result, the intended transparency is hindered, and individuals struggle to gain valuable insights from their data.

DecodeMe is a website that aims to transform transparency into insights. By allowing you to upload your JSON files, DecodeMe provides a visualized overview of the contents, enabling you to gain meaningful insights and make informed choices regarding your data protection. In addition, DecodeMe helps you request your own data. Our goal is to assist you on your journey towards data protection.
